Create a more info button next to each question that describes in detail what we are looking for with that question. For example, the cycle time question could have more information such as: Cycle Time is the amount of time it takes the team to score. This time inculdes going to get a another cube, go across the feild, and score again. This minimizes the amount of confusion that less knowledgable users will have when attempting to scout. To increase our productivity, we want to ensure that our app can be used easily.
